Having a hard time organizing ideas and random thoughts? 
Exploring a wider space for a private workshop? 

BOARDER PLAYGROUND is an online co-work platform allowing users to unleash their creativity and share notes at home, work or on the go.

Whether you're an individual user or accessing BOARDER PLAYGROUND as a team, this platform supports real-time editing and collaboration with sticky notes with unlimited space.

No more scribbled paper notes stuck all over your monitor, desk or notebooks, even scattered everywhere! All boards and post-its within are collected and saved online.
